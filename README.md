A collection of papers I found interesting during my PhD.

Each directory focuses on a different topic, and contains a `BibTex` and `README` file. The `BibTex` file can be directly loaded into reference management program like zotero, whilst the `README` files can be used to easily see the papers contained in the `BibTex` files.
