A collection of papers I found interesting during my PhD.

Each directory focuses on a different topic, and contains a `BibTex` and `README` file. The `BibTex` file can be directly loaded into reference management program like zotero, whilst the `README` files can be used to easily see the papers contained in the `BibTex` files.

If you have come across a paper that fits into any of the catageories in the repo (*more will be coming*), or have a suggestion for a list of papers that could form a new category, please feel free to submit an issue with a DOI or arXiv number for the paper (or list of papers).
