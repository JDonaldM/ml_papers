	abstract = {Using the N-body simulations of the AEMULUS Project, we construct an emulator for the non-linear clustering of galaxies in real and redshift space. We construct our model of galaxy bias using the halo occupation framework, accounting for possible velocity bias. The model includes 15 parameters, including both cosmological and galaxy bias parameters. We demonstrate that our emulator achieves {\textasciitilde} 1\% precision at the scales of interest, 0.1{\textless}r{\textless}10 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc, and recovers the true cosmology when tested against independent simulations. Our primary parameters of interest are related to the growth rate of structure, f, and its degenerate combination fsigma\_8. Using this emulator, we show that the constraining power on these parameters monotonically increases as smaller scales are included in the analysis, all the way down to 0.1 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc. For a BOSS-like survey, the constraints on fsigma\_8 from r{\textless}30 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc scales alone are more than a factor of two tighter than those from the fiducial BOSS analysis of redshift-space clustering using perturbation theory at larger scales. The combination of real- and redshift-space clustering allows us to break the degeneracy between f and sigma\_8, yielding a 9\% constraint on f alone for a BOSS-like analysis. The current AEMULUS simulations limit this model to surveys of massive galaxies. Future simulations will allow this framework to be extended to all galaxy target types, including emission-line galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present a new power spectrum emulator named EuclidEmulator that estimates the nonlinear correction to the linear dark matter power spectrum. It is based on a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in the construction of the emulator have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers \$k{\textbackslash}approx 5{\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ for redshifts \$z{\textbackslash}leq 5\$. The emulator is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab and it has been optimized first by creating mock emulators based on Takahashi's HALOFIT. We show that it is possible to successfully predict the performance of the final emulator in this way prior to performing any N-body simulations. We provide a C-code to calculate the nonlinear correction at a relative accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim0.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ with respect to N-body simulations within 50 ms. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is comparable to one obtained with N-body simulations, i.e. \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash}\%\$ for \$k{\textbackslash}lesssim 1{\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim 3.5\$. This enables efficient forward modeling in the nonlinear regime allowing for maximum likelihood estimation of cosmological parameters. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT and CosmicEmu, an alternative emulator based on the Mira-Titan Universe, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological observables, use higher resolution input simulations and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.},

In this approach, galaxies of a given type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body simulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully nonlinear galaxy power spectrum over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling parameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run on a large LCDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation applied to a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is currently {\textasciitilde}3\% ({\textasciitilde}2\% in the simulation and {\textasciitilde}1\% in the emulation process) from z=1 to z=0, over the considered parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate parametric dependencies in the HOD model, as well as the behavior of galaxy bias as a function of HOD parameters.

	abstract = {We investigate the interpolation of power spectra of matter fluctuations using Artificial Neural Network (PkANN). We present a new approach to confront small-scale non-linearities in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. This ever-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in cosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of precision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally trained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of cosmological parameters (Omega\_m h{\textasciicircum}2, Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2, n\_s, w\_0, sigma\_8, m\_nu and redshift z), can provide a worst-case error {\textless}=1 per cent (for z{\textless}=2) fit to the non-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes up to k{\textless}=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire parameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current matter power spectrum calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate interpolation of the matter power spectrum is achievable with only a sparsely sampled grid of cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body simulations which are computationally expensive and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can be an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological observations and parameter estimation. This paper is the first in a series. In this method paper, we generate the non-linear matter power spectra using HaloFit and use them as mock observations to train the ANN. This work sets the foundation for Paper II, where a suite of N-body simulations will be used to compute the non-linear matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the quasi-non-linear regime 0.1 h/Mpc {\textless}= k {\textless}= 0.9 h/Mpc. A trained ANN based on this N-body suite will be released for the scientific community.},

We assess the performance of the emulator using a validation set of N-body simulations that are not used in training the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo–matter cross-correlation, relevant for galaxy–galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than 2\% and the halo autocorrelation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than 4\%. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. It can be used to study properties of halo mass density proﬁles such as the concentration–mass relation and splashback radius for different cosmologies. The emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo–galaxy connection, such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics, such as galaxy–galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the wCDM cosmologies, in a few CPU seconds.},

	abstract = {The Lyman-alpha forest provides strong constraints on both cosmological parameters and intergalactic medium astrophysics, which are forecast to improve further with the next generation of surveys including eBOSS and DESI. As is generic in cosmological inference, extracting this information requires a likelihood to be computed throughout a high-dimensional parameter space. Evaluating the likelihood requires a robust and accurate mapping between the parameters and observables, in this case the 1D flux power spectrum. Cosmological simulations enable such a mapping, but due to computational time constraints can only be evaluated at a handful of sample points; "emulators" are designed to interpolate between these. The problem then reduces to placing the sample points such that an accurate mapping is obtained while minimising the number of expensive simulations required. To address this, we introduce an emulation procedure that employs Bayesian optimisation of the training set for a Gaussian process interpolation scheme. Starting with a Latin hypercube sampling (other schemes with good space-filling properties can be used), we iteratively augment the training set with extra simulations at new parameter positions which balance the need to reduce interpolation error while focussing on regions of high likelihood. We show that smaller emulator error from the Bayesian optimisation propagates to smaller widths on the posterior distribution. Even with fewer simulations than a Latin hypercube, Bayesian optimisation shrinks the 95\% credible volume by 90\% and, e.g., the 1 sigma error on the amplitude of small-scale primordial fluctuations by 38\%. This is the first demonstration of Bayesian optimisation applied to large-scale structure emulation, and we anticipate the technique will generalise to many other probes such as galaxy clustering, weak lensing and 21cm.},

We compare to the previous state of the art, quadratic polynomial interpolation. The Latin hypercube samples the entire volume of parameter space, while quadratic polynomial emulation samples only lower-dimensional subspaces. The Gaussian process provides an estimate of the emulation error and we show using test simulations that this estimate is reasonable. We construct a likelihood function and use it to show that the posterior constraints generated using the emulator are unbiased. We show that our Gaussian process emulator has lower emulation error than quadratic polynomial interpolation and thus produces tighter posterior confidence intervals, which will be essential for future Lyman-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ surveys such as DESI.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01868},
	abstract = {Supernova spectral time series contain a wealth of information about the progenitor and explosion process of these energetic events. The modeling of these data requires the exploration of very high dimensional posterior probabilities with expensive radiative transfer codes. Even modest parametrizations of supernovae contain more than ten parameters and a detailed exploration demands at least several million function evaluations. Physically realistic models require at least tens of CPU minutes per evaluation putting a detailed reconstruction of the explosion out of reach of traditional methodology. The advent of widely available libraries for the training of neural networks combined with their ability to approximate almost arbitrary functions with high precision allows for a new approach to this problem. Instead of evaluating the radiative transfer model itself, one can build a neural network proxy trained on the simulations but evaluating orders of magnitude faster. Such a framework is called an emulator or surrogate model. In this work, we present an emulator for the TARDIS supernova radiative transfer code applied to Type Ia supernova spectra. We show that we can train an emulator for this problem given a modest training set of a hundred thousand spectra (easily calculable on modern supercomputers). The results show an accuracy on the percent level (that are dominated by the Monte Carlo nature of TARDIS and not the emulator) with a speedup of several orders of magnitude. This method has a much broader set of applications and is not limited to the presented problem.},

While various emulation schemes exist to approximate these slow calculations, these approaches are only safe if the approximations are well understood and controlled. This workshop submission reviews and updates a previously published method, which has been used in cosmological simulations, to (1) train an emulator while simultaneously estimating posterior probabilities with MCMC and (2) explicitly propagate the emulation error into errors on the posterior probabilities for model parameters. We demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to quickly estimate posterior distributions for parameters of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology model, while also gauging the robustness of the emulator approximation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10223},
	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently applied as a novel emulation technique for large scale structure simulations. Recent results show that GANs can be used as a fast, efficient and computationally cheap emulator for producing novel weak lensing convergence maps as well as cosmic web data in 2-D and 3-D. However, like any algorithm, the GAN approach comes with a set of limitations, such as an unstable training procedure and the inherent randomness of the produced outputs. In this work we employ a number of techniques commonly used in the machine learning literature to address the mentioned limitations. In particular, we train a GAN to produce both weak lensing convergence maps and dark matter overdensity field data for multiple redshifts, cosmological parameters and modified gravity models. In addition, we train a GAN using the newest Illustris data to emulate dark matter, gas and internal energy distribution data simultaneously. Finally, we apply the technique of latent space interpolation to control which outputs the algorithm produces. Our results indicate a 1-20\% difference between the power spectra of the GAN-produced and the training data samples depending on the dataset used and whether Gaussian smoothing was applied. Finally, recent research on generative models suggests that such algorithms can be treated as mappings from a lower-dimensional input (latent) space to a higher dimensional (data) manifold. We explore such a theoretical description as a tool for better understanding the latent space interpolation procedure.},

Deviations from GR-w(z)CDM models can manifest in the growth rate of structure and lensing, as well as in screening effects on non-linear scales. We explore the constraining power of small-scale deviations predicted by the f(R) Hu-Sawicki Modified Gravity (MG) candidate, by emulating this model with COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration) simulations. We present the experimental design, data generation, and interpolation schemes in cosmological parameters and across redshifts for the emulation of the boost in the power spectra due to Modified Gravity effects. Three preliminary applications of the emulator highlight the sensitivity to cosmological parameters, Fisher forecasting and Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference for a fiducial cosmology.

	abstract = {We present a new, updated version of the EuclidEmulator (called EuclidEmulator2), a fast and accurate predictor for the nonlinear correction of the matter power spectrum. Percent-level accurate emulation is now supported in the eight-dimensional parameter space of \$w\_0w\_a\$CDM\$+{\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\$models between redshift \$z=0\$ and \$z=3\$ for spatial scales within the range 0.01 \$h\$/Mpc \${\textbackslash}leq k {\textbackslash}leq\$ 10 \$h\$/Mpc. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data: (1) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy and the metric field, (2) we perform the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework of general relativity, (3) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with \$3000{\textasciicircum}3\$ particles in boxes of 1 (Gpc/\$h\$)\$\{\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions and (4) we provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution effects in the simulations. We find that the inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter \$w\_a\$ significantly increases the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high fidelity of EuclidEmulator2 is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as well as alternative fast predictors like Halofit, HMCode and CosmicEmu. A blind test is successfully performed against the Euclid Flagship v2.0 simulation. Nonlinear correction factors emulated with EuclidEmulator2 are accurate at the level of 1\% or better for 0.01 \$h\$/Mpc \${\textbackslash}leq k {\textbackslash}leq\$ 10 \$h\$/Mpc and \$z{\textbackslash}leq3\$ compared to high-resolution dark matter only simulations.

In particular, a technique for constraining models with a chameleon screening is introduced. In addition, the outlined technique is expanded to test a wider class of models, such as the theory of emergent gravity. Finally, the first part of the thesis is concluded by adapting the mentioned tests for model independent constraints. The obtained results indicate that galaxy clusters can be used to obtain some of the most powerful constraints on cosmological scales. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the topic of cosmological emulators. More specifically, a technique of emulating cosmological N-body simulation output data based on machine learning is introduced. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to emulate dark matter-only as well as hydrodynamical simulation data. In addition, N-body modified gravity simulations are explored as well. The presented investigation of the GAN algorithm shows that such emulators offer a powerful, fast and efficient way of producing simulation output data with different cosmological parameters. The power spectrum analysis indicates a 1-20\% difference between the training and the generated data depending on the dataset used and whether Gaussian smoothing is applied or not.},

We propose a computationally cheap method to create an emulator for modified gravity models by utilizing existing emulators for \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. Using a suite of \$N\$-body simulations we construct a fitting function for the enhancement of both the linear and non-linear matter power spectrum in the commonly studied Hu-Sawicki \$f(R)\$ gravity model valid for wave-numbers \$k {\textbackslash}lesssim 5-10{\textbackslash}, h{\textbackslash}text\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and redshifts \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 3\$. We show that the cosmology dependence of this enhancement is relatively weak so that our fit, using simulations coming from only one cosmology, can be used to get accurate predictions for other cosmological parameters. We also show that the cosmology dependence can, if needed, be included by using linear theory, approximate \$N\$-body simulations (such as COLA) and semi-analytical tools like the halo model. Our final fit can easily be combined with any emulator or semi-analytical models for the non-linear \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM power spectrum to accurately, and quickly, produce a non-linear power spectrum for this particular modified gravity model. The method we use can be applied to fairly cheaply construct an emulator for other modified gravity models. As an application of our fitting formula we use it to compute Fisher-forecasts for how well galaxy clustering and weak lensing in a Euclid-like survey will be at constraining modifications of gravity.},

To do this, we use {\textbackslash}textsc\{Dark Emulator\} developed in Nishimichi et al. based on an ensemble of \$N\$-body simulations, which is an emulation package enabling a fast, accurate computation of halo clustering quantities for flat-geometry \$w\$CDM cosmologies. Adopting the halo occupation distribution, the emulator allows us to obtain model predictions of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}Sigma\$ and \$w\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}\$ for the SDSS-like galaxies at a few CPU seconds for an input set of parameters. We present performance and validation of the method by carrying out Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses of the mock signals measured from a variety of mock catalogs that mimic the SDSS and HSC-Y1 galaxies. We show that the halo model method can recover the underlying true cosmological parameters to within the 68{\textbackslash}\% credible interval, except for the mocks including the assembly bias effect (although we consider the unrealistically-large amplitude of assembly bias effect). Even for the assembly bias mock, we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters can be recovered \{{\textbackslash}it if\} the analysis is restricted to scales \$R{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$.

Thus we conclude that the emulator-based halo model method can be safely applied to the HSC-Y1 dataset, achieving a precision of \${\textbackslash}sigma(S\_8){\textbackslash}simeq 0.04\$.},

	abstract = {We present SPECULATOR - a fast, accurate, and flexible framework for emulating stellar population synthesis (SPS) models for predicting galaxy spectra and photometry. For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of \$10{\textasciicircum}3\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ speed up over direct SPS computation. They have readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, whilst maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.},

	abstract = {Emulation of the Global (sky-averaged) 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization with neural networks has been shown to be an essential tool for physical signal modelling. In this paper we present globalemu, a Global 21-cm signal emulator that uses redshift as a character defining variable along side a set of astrophysical parameters to estimate the brightness temperature of the 21-cm signal. Combined with a physically motivated pre-processing of the data this makes for a reliable and fast emulator that is relatively insensitive to the neural network design. A single high resolution signal can be emulated in 1.3 ms when using globalemu in comparison to 133 ms, a factor of 102 improvement, when using the existing public state of the art emulator 21cmGEM evaluated with the same computing power. We illustrate, with the same training and test data used for 21cmGEM, that globalemu is almost twice as accurate as 21cmGEM and for 95\% of models in a test set of \${\textbackslash}approx1,700\$ we can achieve a RMSE of \${\textbackslash}leq 5.37\$ mK and a mean RMSE of 2.52 mK across the band z = 7 -28 (approximately 10\% the expected noise of 25 mK for the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH)). Further, globalemu provides a flexible framework in which the neutral fraction history and Global signal models with updated astrophysics can be emulated easily. The emulator is pip installable and available at: https://github.com/htjb/globalemu. globalemu will be used by the REACH collaboration to perform physical signal modelling inside a Bayesian nested sampling loop.},

	abstract = {The linear matter power spectrum is an essential ingredient in all theoretical models for interpreting large-scale-structure observables. Although Boltzmann codes such as CLASS or CAMB are very efficient at computing the linear spectrum, the analysis of data usually requires \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ evaluations, which means this task can be the most computationally expensive aspect of data analysis. Here, we address this problem by building a neural network emulator that provides the linear theory matter power spectrum in about one millisecond with 0.3\% accuracy over \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} {\textbackslash}le k [h{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}] {\textless} 30\$. We train this emulator with more than 150,000 measurements, spanning a broad cosmological parameter space that includes massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. We show that the parameter range and accuracy of our emulator is enough to get unbiased cosmological constraints in the analysis of a Euclid-like weak lensing survey. Complementing this emulator, we train 15 other emulators for the cross-spectra of various linear fields in Eulerian space, as predicted by 2nd-order Lagrangian Perturbation theory, which can be used to accelerate perturbative bias descriptions of galaxy clustering. Our emulators are especially designed to be used in combination with emulators for the nonlinear matter power spectrum and for baryonic effects, all of which are publicly available at http://www.dipc.org/bacco.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02256},
	abstract = {The 3D matter power spectrum, \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}delta\}(k,z)\$ is a fundamental quantity in the analysis of cosmological data such as large-scale structure, 21cm observations, and weak lensing. Existing computer models (Boltzmann codes) such as CLASS can provide it at the expense of immoderate computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast Bayesian method to generate the 3D matter power spectrum, for a given set of wavenumbers, \$k\$ and redshifts, \$z\$. Our code allows one to calculate the following quantities: the linear matter power spectrum at a given redshift (the default is set to 0); the non-linear 3D matter power spectrum with/without baryon feedback; the weak lensing power spectrum. The gradient of the 3D matter power spectrum with respect to the input cosmological parameters is also returned and this is useful for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers. The derivatives are also useful for Fisher matrix calculations. In our application, the emulator is accurate when evaluated at a set of cosmological parameters, drawn from the prior, with the fractional uncertainty, \${\textbackslash}Delta P\_\{{\textbackslash}delta\}/P\_\{{\textbackslash}delta\}\$ centered on 0. It is also \${\textbackslash}sim 300\$ times faster compared to CLASS, hence making the emulator amenable to sampling cosmological and nuisance parameters in a Monte Carlo routine. In addition, once the 3D matter power spectrum is calculated, it can be used with a specific redshift distribution, \$n(z)\$ to calculate the weak lensing and intrinsic alignment power spectra, which can then be used to derive constraints on cosmological parameters in a weak lensing data analysis problem. The software (\${\textbackslash}texttt\{emuPK\}\$) can be trained with any set of points and is distributed on Github, and comes with with a pre-trained set of Gaussian Process (GP) models, based on 1000 Latin Hypercube (LH) samples, which follow roughly the current priors for current weak lensing analyses.},

	abstract = {We present methods for emulating the matter power spectrum which effectively combine information from cosmological \$N\$-body simulations at different resolutions. An emulator allows estimation of simulation output by interpolating across the parameter space of a handful of simulations. We present the first implementation of multi-fidelity emulation in cosmology, where many low-resolution simulations are combined with a few high-resolution simulations to achieve an increased emulation accuracy. The power spectrum's dependence on cosmology is learned from the low-resolution simulations, which are in turn calibrated using high-resolution simulations. We show that our multi-fidelity emulator can achieve percent-level accuracy on average with only \$3\$ high-fidelity simulations and outperforms a single-fidelity emulator that uses \$11\$ simulations. With a fixed number of high-fidelity training simulations, we show that our multi-fidelity emulator is \${\textbackslash}simeq 100\$ times better than a single-fidelity emulator at \$k {\textbackslash}leq 2 {\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash}textrm\{Mpc\}\{{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}simeq 20\$ times better at \$3 {\textbackslash}leq k {\textless} 6.4 {\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash}textrm\{Mpc\}\{{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$.

In this paper, we present an emulator for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. The emulator is based on the baryonification model, containing seven free parameters that are connected to the gas profiles and stellar abundances in haloes. We show that with the baryonic emulator, we can not only recover the power spectra of hydro-dynamical simulations at sub-percent precision but also establish a connection between the baryonic suppression of the power spectrum and the gas and stellar fractions in haloes. This connection allows us to predict the expected deviation from a dark-matter-only power spectrum using measured X-ray gas fractions of galaxy groups and clusters. With these measurements, we constrain the suppression to exceed the percent-level at k = 0.1-0.4 h/Mpc and to reach a maximum of 20-28 percent at around k = 7 h/Mpc (68 percent confidence level). As a further step, we also perform a detailed parameter study and we present a minimum set of four baryonic parameters that are required to recover the scale and redshift dependence observed in hydro-dynamical simulations.

For each parameter combination, or node, we ran four independent simulations, one pair using \$1024{\textasciicircum}3\$ particles in \$500 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc\$ simulation boxes to cover small scales, and another pair using \$512{\textasciicircum}3\$ simulation particles in \$1500 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc\$ boxes for larger scales. Each pair of initial conditions are selected such that sample variance on large scales is minimised on average. In this work we present an accurate emulator for the matter power spectrum in \$f(R)\$ gravity trained on FORGE. We have verified, using the cross-validation technique, that the emulator accuracy is better than \$2.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the majority of nodes, particularly around the center of the explored parameter space, up to scales of \$k = 10 h Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We have also checked the power spectrum emulator against simulations which are not part of our training set and found excellent agreement. Due to its high accuracy on small scales, the FORGE matter power spectrum emulator is well suited for weak lensing analysis and can play a key tool in constraining \$f(R)\$ gravity using current and future observational data.},

These ensembles of simulations of billions of galaxies are computationally demanding, so that more efficient approaches to tracing the non-linear growth of structure are needed. We build a V-Net based model that transforms fast linear predictions into fully nonlinear predictions from numerical simulations. Our NN model learns to emulate the simulations down to small scales and is both faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art approximate methods. It also achieves comparable accuracy when tested on universes of significantly different cosmological parameters from the one used in training.

	abstract = {Models of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos must achieve new levels of precision and accuracy in order to satisfy the requirements of upcoming experiments. In this work, we present a halo bias emulator for modeling the clustering of halos on large scales. It incorporates the cosmological dependence of the bias beyond the mapping of halo mass to peak height. The emulator makes substantial improvements in accuracy compared to the widely used Tinker et al. (2010) model. Halos in this work are defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the mean background density. Halo catalogs are produced for 40 N-body simulations as part of the Aemulus project at snapshots from z=3 to z=0. The emulator is trained over the mass range \$6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}-7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}{\textbackslash} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Using an additional suite of 35 simulations, we determine that the precision of the emulator is redshift dependent, achieving sub-percent levels for a majority of the redshift range. Two additional simulation suites are used to test the ability of the emulator to extrapolate to higher and lower masses. Our high-resolution simulation suite is used to develop an extrapolation scheme in which the emulator asymptotes to the Tinker et al. (2010) model at low mass, achieving {\textasciitilde}3\% accuracy down to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Finally, we present a method to propagate emulator modeling uncertainty into an error budget. Our emulator is made publicly available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/AemulusProject/bias\_emulator\}.},

	abstract = {Context: Modelling satellite galaxy abundance \$N\_s\$ in Galaxy Clusters (GCs) is a key element in modelling the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), which itself is a powerful tool to connect observational studies with numerical simulations. Aims: To study the impact of cosmological parameters on satellite abundance both in cosmological simulations and in mock observations. Methods: We build an emulator (HODEmu, {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/aragagnin/HODEmu/\}) of satellite abundance based on cosmological parameters \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m, {\textbackslash}Omega\_b, {\textbackslash}sigma\_8, h\_0\$ and redshift \$z.\$ We train our emulator using {\textbackslash}magneticum hydrodynamic simulations that span 15 different cosmologies, each over \$4\$ redshift slices between \$0{\textless}z{\textless}0.5,\$ and for each setup we fit normalisation \$A\$, log-slope \${\textbackslash}beta\$ and Gaussian fractional-scatter \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ of the \$N\_s-M\$ relation. The emulator is based on multi-variate output Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Results: We find that \$A\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\$ depend on cosmological parameters, even if weakly, especially on \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m,\$ \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b.\$ This dependency can explain some discrepancies found in literature between satellite HOD of different cosmological simulations (Magneticum, Illustris, BAHAMAS). We also show that satellite abundance cosmology dependency differs between full-physics (FP) simulations, dark-matter only (DMO), and non-radiative simulations. Conclusions: This work provides a preliminary calibration of the cosmological dependency of the satellite abundance of high mass halos, and we showed that modelling HOD with cosmological parameters is necessary to interpret satellite abundance, and we showed the importance of using FP simulations in modelling this dependency.},

For the theoretical template, we use an emulator that was built from an ensemble set of \$N\$-body simulations, which enables fast and accurate computation of the redshift-space power spectrum of halos. Combining with the halo occupation distribution to model the halo-galaxy connection, we can compute the redshift-space power spectrum of BOSS-like galaxies in the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology. In our cosmology inference, we use the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole and include 7 nuisance parameters to model uncertainties in the halo-galaxy connection for each galaxy sample, but do not use any information on the abundance of galaxies. We demonstrate a validation of our analysis pipeline using the mock catalogs of BOSS-like galaxies, generated using different recipes of the halo-galaxy connection and including the assembly bias effect. Assuming weak priors on cosmological parameters, except for \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}h{\textasciicircum}2\$ and \$n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$, we show that our model well reproduces the BOSS power spectra. Including the power spectrum information up to \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}=0.25{\textbackslash},h\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, we find \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}=0.300{\textbackslash}pm0.011\$, \$H\_0=68.35{\textasciicircum}\{+1.21\}\_\{-1.39\}\{{\textbackslash}rm km{\textbackslash},s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8=0.742{\textasciicircum}\{+0.035\}\_\{-0.036\}\$, for the mode and 68{\textbackslash}\% credible interval, after marginalization over nuisance parameters. We find little improvement in the cosmological parameters beyond a maximum wavelength \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}{\textbackslash}simeq 0.2{\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ due to the shot noise domination and marginalization of the halo-galaxy connection parameters.

	abstract = {We constrain the matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}\$ and the amplitude of density fluctuations \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ within the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmological model with shear peak statistics and angular convergence power spectra using mass maps constructed from the first three years of data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). We use tomographic shear peak statistics, including cross-peaks: peak counts calculated on maps created by taking a harmonic space product of the convergence of two tomographic redshift bins. Our analysis follows a forward-modelling scheme to create a likelihood of these statistics using N-body simulations, using a Gaussian process emulator. We include the following lensing systematics: multiplicative shear bias, photometric redshift uncertainty, and galaxy intrinsic alignment. Stringent scale cuts are applied to avoid biases from unmodelled baryonic physics. We find that the additional non-Gaussian information leads to a tightening of the constraints on the structure growth parameter yielding \$S\_8{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}equiv{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}sigma\_8{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}/0.3\}{\textasciitilde}={\textasciitilde}0.797\_\{-0.013\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.015\}\$ (68{\textbackslash}\% confidence limits), with a precision of 1.8{\textbackslash}\%, an improvement of {\textasciitilde}38{\textbackslash}\% compared to the angular power spectra only case. The results obtained with the angular power spectra and peak counts are found to be in agreement with each other and no significant difference in \$S\_8\$ is recorded. We find a mild tension of \$1.5 {\textbackslash}thinspace {\textbackslash}sigma\$ between our study and the results from Planck 2018, with our analysis yielding a lower \$S\_8\$. Furthermore, we observe that the combination of angular power spectra and tomographic peak counts breaks the degeneracy between galaxy intrinsic alignment \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{IA\}\}\$ and \$S\_8\$, improving cosmological constraints. We run a suite of tests concluding that our results are robust and consistent with the results from other studies using DES Y3 data.},

	abstract = {We present a cosmological analysis using the second and third moments of the weak lensing mass (convergence) maps from the first three years of data (Y3) data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The survey spans an effective area of 4139 square degrees and uses the images of over 100 million galaxies to reconstruct the convergence field. The second moment of the convergence as a function of smoothing scale contains information similar to standard shear 2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness, contains additional non-Gaussian information. The data is analysed in the context of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, varying 5 cosmological parameters and 19 nuisance parameters modelling astrophysical and measurement systematics. Our modelling of the observables is completely analytical, and has been tested with simulations in our previous methodology study. We obtain a 1.7{\textbackslash}\% measurement of the amplitude of fluctuations parameter \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_m/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} = 0.784{\textbackslash}pm 0.013\$. The measurements are shown to be internally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales, and between second and third moments. In particular, the measured third moment is consistent with the expectation of gravitational clustering under the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. The addition of the third moment improves the constraints on \$S\_8\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ by \${\textbackslash}sim\$15{\textbackslash}\% and \${\textbackslash}sim\$25{\textbackslash}\% compared to an analysis that only uses second moments. We compare our results with \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\} constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), finding a \$2.2\$ {\textbackslash}textendash \$2.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension in the full parameter space, depending on the combination of moments considered. The third moment independently is in \$2.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}, and thus provides a cross-check on analyses of 2-point correlations.},

	abstract = {We make use of neural networks to accelerate the calculation of power spectra required for the analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing data. For modern perturbation theory codes, evaluation time for a single cosmology and redshift can take on the order of two seconds. In combination with the comparable time required to compute linear predictions using a Boltzmann solver, these calculations are the bottleneck for many contemporary large-scale structure analyses. In this work, we construct neural network-based surrogate models for Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) predictions of matter power spectra, real and redshift space galaxy power spectra, and galaxy--matter cross power spectra that attain \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (at one sigma) accuracy over a broad range of scales in a \$w\$CDM parameter space. The neural network surrogates can be evaluated in approximately one millisecond, a factor of 1000 times faster than the full Boltzmann code and LPT computations. In a simulated full-shape redshift space galaxy power spectrum analysis, we demonstrate that the posteriors obtained using our surrogates are accurate compared to those obtained using the full LPT model. We make our surrogate models public at https://github.com/sfschen/EmulateLSS, so that others may take advantage of the speed gains they provide to enable rapid iteration on analysis settings, something that is essential in complex contemporary large-scale structure analyses.},

	abstract = {We present a novel analysis for cluster cosmology that fully forward models the abundances, weak lensing, and the clustering of galaxy clusters. Our analysis notably includes an empirical model for the anisotropic boosts impacting the lensing and clustering signals of optical clusters. These boosts arise from a preferential selection of clusters surrounded by anisotropic large scale structure, a consequence of the limited discrimination between line-of-sight interlopers and true cluster members offered by photometric surveys. We validate our analysis via a blind cosmology challenge on mocks, and find that we can obtain tight and unbiased cosmological constraints without informative priors or external calibrations on any of our model parameters. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters, and find results favoring low \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ and high \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, combining to yield the lensing strength constraint \$S\_8 = 0.718\_\{-0.015\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.016\}\$. We investigate potential drivers behind these results through a series of post-unblinding tests, noting that our results are consistent with existing cluster cosmology constraints but clearly inconsistent with other CMB/LSS based cosmology results. From these tests, we find hints that a suppression in the cluster lensing signal may be driving our results.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12741},
	abstract = {Matter power spectra emulators, such as the Euclid Emulator and CosmicEmu, are trained on simulations to correct the non-linear part of the power spectrum. Map-based analyses retrieve additional non-Gaussian information from the density field, whether through human-designed statistics such as peak counts, or via machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks. The simulations required for these methods are very resource-intensive, both in terms of computing time and storage. Map-level density field emulators, based on deep generative models, have recently been proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we present a novel mass map emulator of the KiDS-1000 survey footprint, which generates noise-free spherical maps in a fraction of a second. It takes a set of cosmological parameters \$({\textbackslash}Omega\_M, {\textbackslash}sigma\_8)\$ as input and produces a consistent set of 5 maps, corresponding to the KiDS-1000 tomographic redshift bins. To construct the emulator, we use a conditional generative adversarial network architecture and the spherical convolutional neural network \${\textbackslash}texttt\{DeepSphere\}\$, and train it on N-body-simulated mass maps. We compare its performance using an array of quantitative comparison metrics: angular power spectra \$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$, pixel/peaks distributions, \$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$ correlation matrices, and Structural Similarity Index. Overall, the agreement on these summary statistics is \${\textless}10{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the cosmologies at the centre of the simulation grid, and degrades slightly on grid edges. Finally, we perform a mock cosmological parameter estimation using the emulator and the original simulation set. We find a good agreement in these constraints, for both likelihood and likelihood-free approaches. The emulator is available at https://tfhub.dev/cosmo-group-ethz/models/kids-cgan/1.},

The emulators replace the computation of matter and CMB power spectra from Boltzmann codes; thus, they do not need to be re-trained for different choices of astrophysical nuisance parameters or redshift distributions. The matter power spectrum emulation error is less than \$0.4{\textbackslash}\%\$ in the wavenumber range \$k {\textbackslash}in [10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}, 10] {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, for redshift \$z {\textbackslash}in [0, 5]\$. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ emulates CMB temperature, polarisation and lensing potential power spectra in the \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ region of parameter space around the \${\textbackslash}it\{Planck\}\$ best fit values with an error \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the expected shot noise for the forthcoming Simons Observatory. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ is showcased on a joint cosmic shear and galaxy clustering analysis from the Kilo-Degree Survey, as well as on a Stage IV \${\textbackslash}it\{Euclid\}\$-like simulated cosmic shear analysis.

The emulators always recover the fiducial cosmological constraints with differences in the posteriors smaller than sampling noise, while providing a speed-up factor up to \$O(10{\textasciicircum}4)\$ to the complete inference pipeline. This acceleration allows posterior distributions to be recovered in just a few seconds, as we demonstrate in the \${\textbackslash}it\{Planck\}\$ likelihood case. \${\textbackslash}it\{CosmoPower\}\$ is written entirely in Python, can be interfaced with all commonly used cosmological samplers and is publicly available at https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower .},

The suite of emulators consists of four linear component emulators, from which fast linear predictions of the power spectrum can be made, allowing all nonlinearities to be included in predictions from a nonlinear boost component emulator. The linear component emulators includes an emulator for the matter transfer function that produces predictions in \${\textbackslash}sim 0.0004 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}\$, with an error of \${\textless}0.08{\textbackslash}\%\$ (at \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level) on scales \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash} h {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textless}k{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}1 {\textbackslash} h {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

	abstract = {In this work we present the results of the study of the cosmic microwave background TT power spectrum through auto-encoders in which the latent variables are the cosmological parameters. This method was trained and calibrated using a data-set composed by 80000 power spectra from random cosmologies computed numerically with the CAMB code. Due to the specific architecture of the auto-encoder, the encoder part is a model that estimates the maximum-likelihood parameters from a given power spectrum. On the other hand, the decoder part is a model that computes the power spectrum from the cosmological parameters and can be used as a forward model in a fully Bayesian analysis. We show that the encoder is able to estimate the true cosmological parameters with a precision varying from \${\textbackslash}approx 0.004{\textbackslash}\% \$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 0.2{\textbackslash}\% \$ (depending on the cosmological parameter), while the decoder computes the power spectra with a mean percentage error of \${\textbackslash}approx 0.0018{\textbackslash}\% \$ for all the multipole range. We also demonstrate that the decoder recovers the expected trends when varying the cosmological parameters one by one, and that it does not introduce any significant bias on the estimation of cosmological parameters through a Bayesian analysis. These studies gave place to the Cosmic Kite python software that is publicly available and can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/Martindelosrios/cosmic-kite. Although this algorithm does not improve the precision of the measurements compared with the traditional methods, it reduces significantly the computation time and represents the first attempt towards forcing the latent variables to have a physical interpretation.},

We focus on the monopole and quadrupole of the redshift-space correlation function, and the projected correlation function, at scales of \$0.1{\textbackslash}sim60{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$Mpc. Although our simulations are based on \$w\$CDM with general relativity (GR), we include a scaling parameter of the halo velocity field, \${\textbackslash}gamma\_f\$, defined as the amplitude of the halo velocity field relative to the GR prediction. We divide the BOSS data into three redshift bins. After marginalizing over other cosmological parameters, galaxy bias parameters, and the velocity scaling parameter, we find \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.25) = 0.404{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$, \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.4) = 0.444{\textbackslash}pm0.025\$ and \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{8\}(z=0.55) = 0.385{\textbackslash}pm0.019\$. Compared with Planck observations using a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, our results are lower by \$2.29{\textbackslash}sigma\$, \$1.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$4.58{\textbackslash}sigma\$ respectively. These results are consistent with other recent simulation-based results at non-linear scales, including weak lensing measurements of BOSS LOWZ galaxies, two-point clustering of eBOSS LRGs, and an independent clustering analysis of BOSS LOWZ. All these results are generally consistent with a combination of \${\textbackslash}gamma\_f{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}{\textbackslash}sigma\_8{\textbackslash}approx 0.75\$. We note, however, that the BOSS data is well fit assuming GR, i.e. \${\textbackslash}gamma\_f=1\$. We cannot rule out an unknown systematic error in the galaxy bias model at non-linear scales, but near-future data and modeling will enhance our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection, and provide a strong test of new physics beyond the standard model.},

Yet, realistically these techniques will be able to produce high-precision non-linear matter power spectra only for a restricted sub-set of extensions to the "vanilla" \$\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}\$CDM cosmology. I will present a promising alternative to alleviate these shortcomings that draws strength from the combination of halo model, perturbation theory and emulators--the reaction framework.

	abstract = {We present a novel simulation-based hybrid emulator approach that maximally derives cosmological and Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) information from non-linear galaxy clustering, with sufficient precision for DESI Year 1 (Y1) analysis. Our hybrid approach first samples the HOD space on a fixed cosmological simulation grid to constrain the high-likelihood region of cosmology+HOD parameter space, and then constructs the emulator within this constrained region. This approach significantly reduces the parameter volume emulated over, thus achieving much smaller emulator errors with fixed number of training points. We demonstrate that this combined with state-of-the-art simulations result in tight emulator errors comparable to expected DESI Y1 LRG sample variance. We leverage the new AbacusSummit simulations and apply our hybrid approach to CMASS non-linear galaxy clustering data. We infer constraints on \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.762{\textbackslash}pm0.024\$ and \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8 (z\_\{eff\} = 0.52) = 0.444{\textbackslash}pm0.016\$, the tightest among contemporary galaxy clustering studies. We also demonstrate that our \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ constraint is robust against secondary biases and other HOD model choices, a critical first step towards showcasing the robust cosmology information accessible in non-linear scales. We speculate that the additional statistical power of DESI Y1 should tighten the growth rate constraints by at least another 50-60\%, significantly elucidating any potential tension with Planck. We also address the "lensing is low" tension, where we find that the combined effect of a lower \$f{\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ and environment-based bias lowers the predicted lensing signal by 15\%, accounting for approximately 50\% of the discrepancy between the lensing measurement and clustering-based predictions.},

	abstract = {Bayesian parameter inference is an essential tool in modern cosmology, and typically requires the calculation of \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$--\$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ theoretical models for each inference of model parameters for a given dataset combination. Computing these models by solving the linearised Einstein-Boltzmann system usually takes tens of CPU core-seconds per model, making the entire process very computationally expensive. In this paper we present {\textbackslash}textsc\{connect\}, a neural network framework emulating {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\} computations as an easy-to-use plug-in for the popular sampler {\textbackslash}textsc\{MontePython\}. {\textbackslash}textsc\{connect\} uses an iteratively trained neural network which emulates the observables usually computed by {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\}. The training data is generated using {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\}, but using a novel algorithm for generating favourable points in parameter space for training data, the required number of {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\}-evaluations can be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to a traditional inference run. Once {\textbackslash}textsc\{connect\} has been trained for a given model, no additional training is required for different dataset combinations, making {\textbackslash}textsc\{connect\} many orders of magnitude faster than {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\} (and making the inference process entirely dominated by the speed of the likelihood calculation). For the models investigated in this paper we find that cosmological parameter inference run with {\textbackslash}textsc\{connect\} produces posteriors which differ from the posteriors derived using {\textbackslash}textsc\{class\} by typically less than \$0.01\$--\$0.1\$ standard deviations for all parameters. We also stress that the training data can be produced in parallel, making efficient use of all available compute resources.

The neural network architecture makes the model differentiable by construction, providing a powerful tool for fast field level inference. We test the accuracy of our method by considering several summary statistics, including the density power spectrum with and without redshift space distortions, the displacement power spectrum, the momentum power spectrum, the density bispectrum, halo abundances, and halo profiles with and without redshift space distortions. We compare these statistics from our emulator with the full N-body results, the COLA method, and a fiducial neural network with no cosmological dependence. We find our emulator gives accurate results down to scales of \$k {\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, h\$, representing a considerable improvement over both COLA and the fiducial neural network.

To model the baryonic feedback, we adopt a baryonic correction model and use the numerical package {\textbackslash}texttt\{Baccoemu\} to accelerate the evaluation of the baryonic nonlinear matter power spectrum. We design our analysis pipeline to focus on the constraints of the baryonic suppression effects, utilizing the implication given by a principal component analysis on the Fisher forecasts. Our constraint on the baryonic effects can then be used to better model and ameliorate the effects of baryons in producing cosmological constraints from the next generation large-scale structure surveys. We detect the baryonic suppression on the cosmic shear measurements with a \${\textbackslash}sim 2 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance. The characteristic halo mass for which half of the gas is ejected by baryonic feedback is constrained to be \$M\_c {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{13.2\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (95{\textbackslash}\% C.L.). The best-fit baryonic suppression is \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$k=1.0 \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textbackslash} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 15{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$k=5.0 \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\} {\textbackslash} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Our findings are robust with respect to the assumptions about the cosmological parameters, specifics of the baryonic model, and intrinsic alignments.},

	abstract = {We develop a set of machine-learning based cosmological emulators, to obtain fast model predictions for the \$C({\textbackslash}ell)\$ angular power spectrum coefficients characterising tomographic observations of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing from multi-band photometric surveys (and their cross-correlation). A set of neural networks are trained to map cosmological parameters into the coefficients, achieving a speed-up \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(10{\textasciicircum}3)\$ in computing the required statistics for a given set of cosmological parameters, with respect to standard Boltzmann solvers, with an accuracy better than \$0.175{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textless}0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the weak lensing case). This corresponds to \${\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}\%\$ or less of the statistical error bars expected from a typical Stage IV photometric surveys. Such overall improvement in speed and accuracy is obtained through (\${\textbackslash}textit\{i\}\$) a specific pre-processing optimisation, ahead of the training phase, and (\${\textbackslash}textit\{ii\}\$) a more effective neural network architecture, compared to previous implementations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14727},
	abstract = {We provide perturbation theory predictions for the HI intensity mapping power spectrum multipoles using the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which should allow us to constrain cosmological parameters exploiting mildly nonlinear scales. Assuming survey specifications typical of proposed interferometric HI intensity mapping experiments like CHORD and PUMA, and realistic ranges of validity for the perturbation theory modelling, we run mock full shape MCMC analyses at a redshift bin centred at \$z=0.5\$, and compare with Stage-IV optical galaxy surveys. We include the impact of 21cm foreground removal using simulations-based prescriptions, and quantify the effects on the precision and accuracy of the parameter estimation. We vary 10 parameters in total: 3 cosmological and 7 bias and counterterms parameters. Amongst them, the 4 parameters of interest are: the cold dark matter density, \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{c\}\$, the Hubble parameter, \$h\$, the primordial amplitude of the power spectrum, \$A\_\{s\}\$, and the linear HI bias, \$b\_1\$. For the best case scenario, we obtain unbiased constraints on all parameters with \${\textless}3{\textbackslash}\%\$ errors at \$68{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence level. When we include the foreground removal effects, the parameter estimation becomes strongly biased, with all parameters being \${\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ away from the true values. We find that scale cuts \$k\_\{min\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.03 {\textbackslash}, h/Mpc\$ are required to return accurate estimates for \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{c\}\$ and \$h\$, at the price of a decrease in the precision, while \$A\_\{s\}\$ and \$b\_1\$ remain biased. We comment on the implications of these results for current and forthcoming real data analyses.},
